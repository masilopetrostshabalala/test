    <h4>Dear Mr/Ms.[Hiring Manager's Last-Name],</h4>

    <p>I'm excited to be applying for the Software Engineer position at Hiring Company.ORG. As someone who is highlyfocused and 
        attentive to details, I thrive on building quality systems that surpass end users' expectations. I'm thrilled at the opportunity 
        to show off my technical expertise and leadership skills as part of Hiring Company.ORG's expert team.
    </p>

    <p>During my previous role at Gieseck & Devrient SA, PageAutomation and Deposita Systems, I was charged with developing innovative solutions 
        across a variety of Software platforms. I was instrumental in developing mobile-ready expense tracking software for our fast-growing portfolio
        of real estate clients. In 2009, I led the development of a proprietary document management system and  was responsible for the successful migration 
        of all client content from our legacy system to the new platform. I am also attentive to the need for continued process improvements. When  we faced repeated
        deadline delays due to Quality Assurance challenges, I proposed and carried out the implementation of an automated bug tracking system to identify potential
        issues earlier in the development cycle. This resulted in an average of 43% fewer defects reported during late-stages QA reviews and a 32% reduction in days between
        project kickedoff and production launch.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more details about Software Engineer position at Hiring Company.ORG. 
        I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage my unique range of skills, and I'm eager to demonstrate my commitment to developing world-class software solution for Hiring Company.ORG. 
    </p>
     
    <h5>Sincerely</h5>
    <h6>Masilo Petros Tshabalala</h6>
